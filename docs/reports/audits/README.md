# Audit Reports Directory

This directory contains comprehensive audit reports generated by the 360° audit system.

## ⚠️ Security Notice

**IMPORTANT:** Many audit reports in this directory contain **sensitive information** including:
- Real credential values (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Internal IP addresses and network topology
- Security vulnerabilities and exploitation details
- Business metrics and financial projections
- Confidential compliance assessments

## File Naming Convention

### Sensitive Reports (Gitignored)

These files contain credentials/PII and are **automatically excluded from git**:

- `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` - Contains credential snippets
- `RISK_PRIORITY_MATRIX.md` - Contains credential values
- `TECHNICAL_DEEP_DIVE.md` - Contains detailed security info
- `CREDENTIAL_EXPOSURE_REPORT.md` - Contains all credentials
- `index.html` - Interactive dashboard with credential snippets
- `DEBUGGABILITY_OBSERVABILITY_ASSESSMENT.md` - Contains configuration details
- `OBSERVABILITY_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` - Contains metrics with potential PII
- `SRE_*.md` - Contains infrastructure details

**Convention:** Use `*.priv.md` or `*.private.md` for any new sensitive reports

### Safe Reports (Can be committed)

To create a shareable version of a report:

1. **Redact sensitive data:**
   ```bash
   # Create redacted version
   cat EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md | \
     sed 's/rpa_[A-Za-z0-9_]*/rpa_REDACTED/g' | \
     sed 's/glsa_[A-Za-z0-9_]*/glsa_REDACTED/g' | \
     sed 's/[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}/REDACTED_IP/g' \
     > EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_REDACTED.md
   ```

2. **Use the `_REDACTED.md` suffix** - These are allowed in git (see .gitignore)

## 🌐 Interactive Dashboard

**NEW:** Beautiful web-based dashboard with markdown rendering!

### Quick Start

```bash
# Option 1: Use the helper script (auto-finds available port)
./serve.sh

# Option 2: Manual start
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

Then open: **http://localhost:8888/index.html** (or whichever port the script chose)

### Features

✨ **Dynamic Markdown Rendering** - All `.md` reports display as styled HTML
📊 **Interactive Charts** - Visual dimension scores and performance metrics
🎨 **Dark Theme** - Professional GitHub-inspired design
📱 **Responsive** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
⌨️ **Keyboard Shortcuts** - `Esc` (back), `Ctrl+P` (print), `?` (help)
🔍 **Table of Contents** - Auto-generated for easy navigation
🖨️ **Print/PDF Export** - Save any report as PDF

### Why Use Local Server?

**Important:** The dashboard must be served via HTTP (not opened as `file://`) due to browser CORS security policies. The Python server is the simplest solution.

## Best Practices

### For Sensitive Reports

1. ✅ **Keep local only** - Don't commit to git
2. ✅ **Encrypt if storing** - Use GPG or disk encryption
3. ✅ **Share securely** - Use encrypted channels (not email)
4. ✅ **Limit access** - Need-to-know basis only
5. ✅ **Create redacted versions** for public/team sharing

### For Sharing Audit Results

**Option 1: Redacted Version**
```bash
# Create shareable version (see redaction script above)
cat REPORT.md | sed 's/credentials/REDACTED/g' > REPORT_REDACTED.md
git add docs/reports/audits/*_REDACTED.md
```

**Option 2: Summary Only**
- Share high-level scores and recommendations
- Omit specific credential values and infrastructure details
- Create custom summary: `AUDIT_SUMMARY_PUBLIC.md`

## .gitignore Protection

All sensitive reports are protected by patterns in `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# Specific sensitive files
docs/reports/audits/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md
docs/reports/audits/RISK_PRIORITY_MATRIX.md
# ... etc

# General patterns for sensitive docs
*.priv
*.priv.md
*.private.md
*.confidential.md

# Allow redacted versions
!docs/reports/audits/*_REDACTED.md
```

## Verification

To verify sensitive files are gitignored:

```bash
# Check what would be committed
git status docs/reports/audits/

# Verify specific file is ignored
git check-ignore -v docs/reports/audits/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md

# Should show: .gitignore:176:docs/reports/audits/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md
```
